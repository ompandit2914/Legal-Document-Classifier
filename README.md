# üß† Multi-Label Document Classification using Transformers

A deep learning project built to classify documents into multiple categories using transformer-based models.  
This system can automatically understand and categorize long textual documents with high accuracy ‚Äî ideal for domains such as legal, research, or business document processing.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-label text classification system** that uses **transformer-based architectures** to identify multiple relevant categories for each document.  
It leverages contextual embeddings from pre-trained transformer models, enabling it to capture the semantic depth and relationships between words and phrases in complex text data.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, label binarization, model fine-tuning, and an inference pipeline. A Streamlit-based interface allows users to upload and classify documents interactively.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop an intelligent model capable of **multi-label document classification**.  
- Fine-tune a transformer model to understand **domain-specific terminology and long-form text**.  
- Enable **real-time document analysis** and **interactive classification** through a web interface.  
- Provide a scalable, reproducible, and explainable pipeline for future research and enterprise use.

## üß© Abstract

This project demonstrates how large language models can be applied for automated document understanding.  
By training on labeled data and fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model, the system learns to predict multiple relevant tags or topics per document.  
A custom chunking and aggregation mechanism allows it to process long documents efficiently, while probability-based thresholding ensures optimal label predictions.  
The final model integrates with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface, allowing document uploads and instant classification feedback.

## üß† Introduction

Manual document classification is a time-consuming and error-prone task, especially when documents belong to multiple thematic categories.  
This project uses **transformer-based natural language understanding** to automate that process.  
By leveraging contextual embeddings, the model effectively identifies semantic relationships and assigns appropriate labels, offering a powerful AI-driven solution for document management, legal tech, and research indexing.

## üß∞ Project Definition

A **multi-label document classifier** that processes text inputs, extracts meaningful patterns, and outputs multiple label probabilities.  
The model handles variable-length documents using dynamic chunking and aggregates predictions through statistical pooling methods (e.g., mean or max).  
The pipeline includes:
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Tokenization and label binarization
- Transformer model fine-tuning
- Evaluation with F1-score metrics
- Model saving and Streamlit-based deployment
